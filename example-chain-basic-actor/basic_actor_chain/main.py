    Starts a stand-alone GenAI-api-like server with the chain loaded so that in can be easily executed locally.
    Note that the chain will need access to a Genai-Gateway server, which could be provided from your
    local machine via the GenAI development proxy. An example of json body to send in invoke POST is
    ```json
       {
          "input": {
             "user_request": "Hi! Nice to meet you! Where's the Queen of Hearts?"
          },

                "client_user_id": "<your-user>",

              }
            }
          }
       }
      ```
      The "config" -> "metadata" -> "__genai_state" is only needed to test while developing locally.

      passing the data to the chain
