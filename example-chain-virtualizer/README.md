# Example Chain with Virtualizer service

This is an example chain to show how to run queries in Virtualizer from a chain.

## Local deployment

To set up the chain locally, follow the steps in the [main README of this repository](../README.md). Here is a summary of the steps:

1. Make sure you have Python >= 3.9 and Poetry >= 2.1 installed.

2. Edit the `pyproject.toml` and change the URL of the `stratio-releases` repository. You should use the URL of the *Stratio GenAI Developer Proxy* Load Balancer including path "/service/genai-api/v1/pypi/simple".

```toml
[[tool.poetry.source]]
name = "stratio-releases"
url = "https://genai-developer-proxy-loadbalancer.your-tenant-genai.yourdomain.com:8080/service/genai-api/v1/pypi/simple/"
priority = "supplemental"
```

3. Install the dependencies with Poetry. Replace `/path/to/your/cert/folder/ca-cert.crt` with the path to the CA certificate file.

```bash
$ poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
$ poetry config certificates.stratio-releases.cert /path/to/your/cert/folder/ca-cert.crt
$ poetry lock --no-update
$ poetry install
```

4. Configure the environment variables executing the script `scripts/create_env_file.py`. You will find the environment variables in the files `genai-env.env` and `genai-env.sh` in the `genai-examples/scripts` folder. This chain uses the following environment variables:

```bash
GENAI_API_SERVICE_NAME=genai-api-test.s000001-genai
VAULT_LOCAL_CLIENT_CERT=/path/to/certs/user.crt
VAULT_LOCAL_CLIENT_KEY=/path/to/certs/user_private.key
VAULT_LOCAL_CA_CERTS=/path/to/certs/ca-cert.crt
VIRTUALIZER_HOST=genai-developer-proxy-loadbalancer.your-tenant-genai.yourdomain.com
VIRTUALIZER_PORT=8080
VIRTUALIZER_BASE_PATH=/service/virtualizer
```

Please note that the Virtualizer host, when using the *Stratio GenAI Developer Proxy*, should be configured with the value provided by the *Stratio GenAI Developer Proxy*.

5. Run the chain `virtualizer_chain/main.py`. You can do it in the terminal or in PyCharm. You can open the Swagger UI in the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.

```bash
poetry run python virtualizer_chain/main.py
```

6. Invoke the chain using the `POST /invoke` endpoint with the following request body. Replace `<your-user>` and `<your-tenant>` with your user and tenant:

```json
{
  "input": {
     "query": "SELECT 1 as id"
  },
  "config": {
    "metadata": {
      "__genai_state": {
        "client_auth_type": "mtls",
        "client_user_id": "<your-user>",
        "client_tenant": "<your-tenant>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployment in the Stratio GenAI API

To deploy the chain in the Stratio GenAI API, follow the steps in the [main README of this repository](../README.md). Here is a summary of the steps:

1. Build the chain package with the command `poetry build`.
2. Open the Swagger UI of the Stratio GenAI API installed in your development environment.
3. Upload the chain package with the endpoint `POST /v1/packages`.
4. Deploy the chain with the endpoint `POST /v1/chains` and the request body:

```json
{
  "chain_id": "virtualizer_chain",
  "chain_config": {
    "package_id": "virtualizer_chain-0.5.0a0",
    "chain_module": "virtualizer_chain.chain",
    "chain_class": "VirtualizerChain",
    "chain_params": {
      "virtualizer_host": "virtualizer.s000001-apps",
      "virtualizer_port": "13422"
    }
  }
}
```

5. Invoke the chain using the `POST /v1/chains/virtualizer_chain/invoke` endpoint with the following request body. You don't need to include your credentials in the metadata, GenAI API will set them automatically:

```json
{
  "input": {
     "query": "SELECT 1 as id"
  }
}
```
